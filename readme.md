# Multilanguage Invoice Extractor with Gemini Pro Vision

This project is a **Streamlit-based web application** that extracts and analyzes invoice details using **Google's Gemini Pro Vision model**. It allows users to upload an invoice image and ask questions about the invoice content. The application leverages the power of **Google's Generative AI** to provide accurate and multilingual responses.

## Features

- **Multilanguage Support**: Extracts and interprets invoice details in multiple languages.
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload invoice images in formats like **JPG, JPEG, and PNG**.
- **Interactive Interface**: Built with **Streamlit** for a user-friendly experience.
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses **Google's Gemini Pro Vision model** to analyze and respond to user queries about the invoice.
